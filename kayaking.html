                        My family likes to kayak when we can. Our kayaks are from Lifetime. We have a total of 8 kayaks.
                        During the summertime we take our kayaks with us camping. We have not tried taking our dogs with
                        us,
                        which is what my dad wants to do. I think they like water too much to stay on. That would be an
                        experience for sure!

            <h2>Where I Kayak</h2>
            <p>
                I have kayaked in a couple of areas. The first time I kayaked was at Lake Cascade. I have kayed a small
                pond
                near Bruneau Dunes State Park. My family took our kayaks to the Oregon Coast in 2019. I kayaked in a
                bay, but it
                was to wavey for me!
