                        My family loves camping. We have a 38 ft pull trailer. It can sleep 10 people comfortably.
                        before this camper we had a 20ish ft pull trailer which was not big enough for our family.

            <h2>Where I Camp</h2>
            <p>
                My family has camped at many places. One of our go to spots is in Homedale, ID. We love to camp
                at state parks. We have camped at Three Island Crossing State park many times and it is our favorite weekend
                camping spot. Bruneau Dunes State Parks is also a great location but only during the cooler months since
                it is desert climate and gets very hot.

                <p>
                    Our favorite trip to date is when we went to the Northern Oregon Coast. We left on a saturday and
                    stayed halfway
                    at a State Park in Oregon. On sunday, we made it to the Oregon Coast where we stayed at Nehalem Bay
                    State Park.
                    We stayed here for 6 nights. We drove halfway home and stayed at Memaloose State Park. We got home
                    the following
                    sunday. This was a 9 day trip which was fantastic. It was such an adventure. Next year, 2021, we
                    have planned a
                    Southern Oregon Coast Trip.
